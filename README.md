# Unemployment Rate Analysis in India During COVID-19

This project analyzes the unemployment rate in India across various regions during the COVID-19 period using a dataset containing monthly unemployment statistics. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization of trends to understand the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment rates.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Region**: The region in India
- **Date**: The date of the data point
- **Frequency**: The frequency of the data collection (e.g., monthly)
- **Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)**: The estimated unemployment rate
- **Estimated Employed**: The estimated number of employed individuals
- **Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)**: The estimated labour participation rate
- **Area**: The area type (e.g., rural or urban)

## Project Steps

1. Load the dataset.
2. Convert the 'Date' column to datetime format.
3. Handle missing values by dropping rows with missing data.

### Step 2: Data Exploration

1. Summarize the dataset.
2. Check for missing values.
3. Filter the dataset for the COVID-19 period (March 2020 onwards).

### Step 3: Data Visualization
